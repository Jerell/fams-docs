# User Interface

We expect the front end to be an interactive dashboard where you can enter data and see the resulting state of the pipeline system.

## Inputs

For each input node, you should be able to enter values such as pressure, temperature, and flow rate.

## Outputs

Calculated values, such as pressure and temperature, will be displayed on screen through tables and visualizations.

## Display

An interactive **SVG network map** can be used to select different parts of the system. This network map will show how the different parts of the system are connected. Using [D3.js](https://d3js.org/), we can modify the SVG to visualize the data.

**Tables** will be used to show precise values.
