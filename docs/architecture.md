# Architecture

This project uses the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) architecture and is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), a [React](https://reactjs.org) framework.

Jamstack is a new standard for modern web applications, which uses JavaScript frameworks, serverless functions, and content delivery networks instead of a more traditional, monolithic structure.
