# Architecture

This project uses the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) architecture and is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), a [React](https://reactjs.org) framework.

Jamstack is a new standard for modern web applications, which uses JavaScript frameworks, serverless functions, and content delivery networks instead of a more traditional, monolithic structure.

The client will probably communicate with microservices because we likely won't process everything in the front end but we haven't planned any of the functionality enough to know how that'll actually look. The image above is just a guess really.
